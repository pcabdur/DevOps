# 🚀 DevOps 60-Day Challenge – Day 2  
## 🐚 Topic: Basic Shell Scripting – Variables, Conditionals & Loops

Today was all about writing our **first shell scripts** — getting comfortable with automation, logic, and control flows in the Linux shell.

---

### 🔧 What I Learned

✅ Declaring variables and printing them  
✅ Writing `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements  
✅ Looping with `for` and `while`  
✅ Using `chmod +x` to execute scripts

### 📂 Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `variables.sh` | Script demonstrating variable usage |
| `conditions.sh` | Script with if-else logic |
| `loops.sh` | Script using both `for` and `while` loops |

🧠 **My Reflection**:  
This was a solid entry into scripting. It felt like programming in bash — automating small steps that could scale into larger pipelines. I understood how DevOps uses scripting as the glue between tools and tasks.
