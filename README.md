# 🚀 My DevOps Journey – 60 Days of Learning

Welcome to my DevOps challenge!  
This is a hands-on documentation of my learning path — with each day bringing something new, real, and deeply technical.

## 🧠 What I Did – In My Perspective

---

### 🗂️ Day 1 – Linux Basics

I explored:
- File system navigation
- User and group management
- Permission handling using `chmod`, `chown`
- Basic but essential commands that make you feel in control

> "Felt like talking to the machine in its native language."

### 🧪 Day 2 – Git & GitHub

Set up:
- `git init`, `add`, `commit`, and `remote`
- Cloned repos, pushed changes, and understood `.gitignore`
- Dealt with errors like `dubious ownership` (solved using `safe.directory`)

> "Now Git feels like a time machine I can control."

### 📝 Day 3 – Vim, Nano, Shell Scripting

- Mastered navigation in Vim (`:wq`, `i`, `dd`, etc.)
- Wrote simple `.sh` scripts to automate routine commands
- Realized how shell scripting brings power with just a few lines

> "Automating even a small task feels like a superpower."

### 🧵 Day 4 – Pipes, Redirection & Grep

- Learned how to use `>` `>>` `<` to redirect files
- Connected multiple commands using pipes (`|`)
- Used `grep` like a boss to filter logs
- Scheduled tasks using `cron`, practiced real examples

> "Now I can chain commands like thoughts — no GUI, just raw flow."

### 🌿 Day 5 – Git Branching & Merging

- Created and switched branches (`git checkout -b`)
- Merged changes and practiced solving conflicts
- Understood rebase vs merge with actual files

> "Conflicts in Git feel like arguments — you've got to listen, not panic."
